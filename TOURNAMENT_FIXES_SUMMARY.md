# Tournament System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Prize Distribution Calculation Issues
**Problem**: Inconsistent prize pool calculations between different components
**Fix**: 
- Standardized all components to use `currentPrizePool` as the single source of truth
- Fixed `getPrizeAmount()` function to always calculate from current prize pool
- Updated PrizesTab, LivePrizePool, TournamentHeader, and TournamentSidebar components

**Fix**:
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff in email service
- Improved error handling to show user-friendly messages
- Separated prize distribution success from email notification failures
- Added connection pooling and timeout settings to email transporter

### 3. Participant Validation Issues
**Problem**: Undefined UID errors when processing tournament participants
**Fix**:
- Enhanced participant structure handling in email service
- Added proper validation for both old and new participant formats
- Improved error messages for missing participant data

### 4. Prize Distribution UI/UX Issues
**Problem**: Confusing error messages and unclear prize calculations
**Fix**:
- Added better duplicate winner validation
- Improved error messages for network issues
- Enhanced confirmation dialog with detailed prize breakdown
- Fixed number formatting throughout the application

### 5. Tournament Join Logic
**Problem**: Inconsistent participant checking across components
**Fix**:
- Standardized participant validation using both `participantUids` and `participants` arrays
- Fixed join tournament function call signature
- Enhanced duplicate checking logic

## Technical Improvements

### Email Service Enhancements
- Added connection pooling for better reliability
- Implemented retry logic for network failures
- Enhanced error categorization and user feedback
- Improved timeout settings for stable connections

### Prize Distribution Robustness
- Separated transaction success from notification delivery
- Added better validation for prize amounts
- Enhanced error handling with specific error types
- Improved user feedback for different failure scenarios

### Data Consistency
- Standardized number formatting with `.toLocaleString()`
- Ensured all components use `currentPrizePool` consistently
- Added proper validation for tournament creation
- Enhanced participant structure handling

### Error Handling
- Network errors now show user-friendly messages
- Prize distribution failures are properly categorized
- Email notification failures don't affect transaction success
- Better error recovery and user guidance
