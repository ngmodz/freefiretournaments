# Bug Fixes Documentation

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Tournament Panel Email Duplication Issue**

#### Problem:
- Tournament panel emails were being triggered twice for both host and participants
- Multiple cron jobs from cron-job.org were triggering different APIs that all sent emails
- No proper deduplication mechanism was in place

#### Root Cause:
Multiple notification systems were running simultaneously:
- `automated-moderator.js` - Flags tournaments for penalty/cancellation
- `process-notifications.js` - Processes flagged tournaments and sends emails  
- `tournament-management.js` - Tournament notification check functionality
- Various other notification scripts

#### Fixes Applied:

1. **Added duplicate prevention flags in `automated-moderator.js`:**
   - Added `moderator_processed` flag to prevent re-processing
   - Added `moderator_processed_at` timestamp for tracking
   - Added check for `!tournament.moderator_processed` before flagging for penalty

2. **Enhanced `process-notifications.js` with deduplication:**
   - Added `penalty_notification_sent` flag and timestamp
   - Added `cancellation_notification_sent` flag and timestamp
   - Skip processing if notifications already sent
   - Added success logging for tracking

3. **Improved `tournament-management.js` notification system:**
   - Added check for `tournament.notificationSent` before processing
   - Added `notificationSentAt` timestamp when marking as sent
   - Prevents duplicate processing in same run and across runs

#### Recommended Cron Job Configuration:
**Only use ONE of the following endpoints in your cron-job.org:**

- **For tournament start notifications:** `/api/tournament-management?action=checkNotifications`
- **For penalty/cancellation processing:** `/api/process-notifications`

**Do NOT run multiple notification APIs simultaneously.**

### 2. **Host Penalty Credit Deduction Bug**

#### Problem:
- Host penalties were deducting from `hostCredits` instead of `tournamentCredits`
- When tournament credits were less than 10, the system wasn't allowing negative balances
- This prevented proper penalty enforcement

#### Root Cause:
In both `credit-management.js` and `functions/index.js`, the penalty system was incorrectly using:
```javascript
const currentCredits = wallet.hostCredits || 0; // WRONG
transaction.update(userRef, { "wallet.hostCredits": newCredits }); // WRONG
```

#### Fixes Applied:

1. **Updated `credit-management.js`:**
   ```javascript
   // Fixed to use tournamentCredits and allow negative balances
   const currentTournamentCredits = wallet.tournamentCredits || 0;
   const newTournamentCredits = currentTournamentCredits - penaltyAmount;
   transaction.update(userRef, { "wallet.tournamentCredits": newTournamentCredits });
   ```

2. **Updated `functions/index.js`:**
   ```javascript
   // Fixed to use tournamentCredits and allow negative balances  
   const currentTournamentCredits = wallet.tournamentCredits || 0;
   const newTournamentCredits = currentTournamentCredits - penaltyAmount;
   transaction.update(userRef, { "wallet.tournamentCredits": newTournamentCredits });
   ```

3. **Updated transaction logging:**
   - Changed `walletType` from `"hostCredits"` to `"tournamentCredits"`
   - Proper balance tracking in credit transactions

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Email Duplication Testing:
1. Create a test tournament starting in 21 minutes
2. Monitor email delivery to ensure only ONE notification is sent
3. Check database for proper flag settings:
   - `notificationSent: true`
   - `notificationSentAt: <timestamp>`

### 2. Penalty System Testing:
1. Create a tournament with a host who has less than 10 tournament credits
2. Let the tournament go past the 10-minute mark without starting
3. Verify:
   - Tournament credits go negative (e.g., 5 credits - 10 penalty = -5 credits)
   - Host credits remain unchanged
   - Penalty email is sent only once

### 3. Cancellation System Testing:
1. Create a tournament that goes past 20 minutes without starting
2. Verify:
   - Tournament gets cancelled
   - Participants get refunded to tournament credits
   - Cancellation emails sent only once to host and participants

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Cron Job Setup:
- **Frequency:** Every 2 minutes for tournament notifications
- **URL:** `https://freefiretournaments.vercel.app/api/tournament-management?action=checkNotifications&secret=YOUR_SECRET`
- **URL:** `https://freefiretournaments.vercel.app/api/process-notifications?secret=YOUR_SECRET`
- **URL:** `https://freefiretournaments.vercel.app/api/automated-moderator?secret=YOUR_SECRET`

### 2. Database Monitoring:
Monitor these fields in tournament documents:
- `notificationSent` - Prevents duplicate start notifications
- `moderator_processed` - Prevents duplicate penalty/cancellation flags
- `penalty_notification_sent` - Prevents duplicate penalty emails
- `cancellation_notification_sent` - Prevents duplicate cancellation emails

### 3. Log Monitoring:
Watch for these log messages:
- `✅ Penalty notification sent to host: <email>`
- `✅ Cancellation notification sent to host: <email>`
- `✅ Cancellation notification sent to participant: <email>`
- `[ID] Notification already sent, skipping.`

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Better Error Handling:** Added specific error messages for debugging
2. **Timestamp Tracking:** All notification flags now include timestamps
3. **Improved Logging:** More detailed success/skip logging for troubleshooting
4. **Transaction Safety:** All credit operations use proper transaction boundaries

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy changes** to your Vercel environment
2. **Update your cron-job.org** configuration to avoid overlapping calls
3. **Monitor email delivery** for the first few tournaments
4. **Test penalty system** with a low-credit host account
5. **Verify database flags** are being set correctly

---

**Note:** These fixes address the core issues but you should monitor the system closely after deployment to ensure everything works as expected.
